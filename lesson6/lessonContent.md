## Assignment

Develop a Basic Audio Generative Model

### Objective

Implement a basic audio generative model using either WaveNet or a GAN-based architecture.

### Expected Capabilities

- Implement data pre-processing pipeline for audio
- Develop a simple generative model for audio
- Evaluate model performance using both metrics and osubjective methods

### Instructions

#### Part 1

**Pre-process the Audio Dataset**

Load and pre-process an audio dataset using Librosa. Extract MFCC features.

```
import librosa
signal, sr = librosa.load('audio_file.wav', sr=16000)
mfccs = librosa.feature.mfcc(y=signal, sr=sr, n_mfcc=20)
```

**Design and Train Generative Model**

Choose either WaveNet or GAN, design the model architecture, and train it on the pre-processed audio data.

```
model = WaveNetModel(layer_size=30, stack_size=5, dilations=[1, 2, 4, 8])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy')
```

**Evaluate Model on Test Data**

Use PESQ or listener tests to evaluate the generated audio samples.

```
score = pesq(fs, ref_signal, degraded_signal, 'wb')
```

### Tasks

#### Task 1: Implement the Audio Pre-processing Pipeline

Write scripts to load audio files and apply transformations like MFCC conversion.

```
import librosa
signal, sr = librosa.load('audio_file.wav', sr=16000)
mfccs = librosa.feature.mfcc(y=signal, sr=sr, n_mfcc=20)
```

#### Task 2: Build and Train the Model

Configure and train a WaveNet or WaveGAN model on the prepared dataset.

```
model = WaveNetModel(layer_size=30, stack_size=5, dilations=[1, 2, 4, 8])
```

### Understanding Audio Data in Generative Models

Audio data needs to be represented in a numerical form that models can interpret. Common representations include waveform, spectrograms, and Fourier transformed data. Each representation has its pros and cons depending on the type of generative task.

### Pre-processing Audio Data for Generative Models

· Audio normalization is crucial to reduce the range of values and stabilize training.
· Feature extraction is conducted to convert audio signals into feature vectors (e.g., MFCC – Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients).
· Data augmentation can be applied to increase dataset size by introducing noise or shifting pitch.

### Creating Generative Models for Audio

Different models can be used for generating audio: 
- **WaveNet**: Generates high-fidelity audio with autoregressive models.
- **GAN-based models**: Such as WaveGAN, which focus on generating raw audio directly using adversarial training.

### WaveNet Example Code:
```python
model = WaveNetModel(layer_size=30, stack_size=5, dilations=[1, 2, 4, 8])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy')
```

**Quizzes:**

**Which model is primarily used for high-fidelity audio generation?**

- WaveGAN
- WaveNet
- AutoEncoder

**Answer:** WaveNet

### Evaluating Generative Audio Models

Generative audio models can be evaluated using subjective and objective methods:
- **Subjective Methods**: Listener tests are conducted for human perception evaluation.
- **Objective Methods**: Use metrics like Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and log-likelihood.

```python
# Sample code for evaluation with PySAR GIST
from pesq import pesq
score = pesq(fs, ref_signal, degraded_signal, 'nb')
```

**Video URL:** http://video.com/evaluatingAudioModels

**Code Examples:**

```
# Using PESQ for objective evaluation
from pesq import pesq
score = pesq(fs, ref_signal, degraded_signal, 'wb')
```

**Quizzes:**

**What does SNR stand for in the context of audio evaluation?**

- Signal Notation Review
- Sound Noise Ratio
- Signal-to-Noise Ratio
